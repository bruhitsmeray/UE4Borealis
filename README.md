# UE4Borealis

UE4Borealis contains the theme developed and used by Project Borealis in their fork of Unreal Engine (4.27). I quite like it and I wanted to use it with my regular version of UE4. I'll leave this repo public in case anyone wants to try it out too.

## Instalation

1. Go to your "Content" folder inside of your Engine install.
2. Make sure to copy the "Editor" and "Slate" folders to have them as backup. If you don't, you'll have to reinstall the Engine whenever you'll decide that this theme is not for you.
3. Copy the contents of this repo inside the "Content" folder. When asked if you want to override some of the files, hit "Yes".
4. After all of that, open Unreal Engine and have fun!
